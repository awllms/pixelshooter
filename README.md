# Pixel Shooter

## Theme
Project for UCLA CS174A.

Our project is based on the popular game "Duck Game," released in 2014. The game is a local multiplayer shooter where players control ducks who can use various weapons to eliminate each other.

This proposal is for a new video game with similar mechanics to Duck Game. The game will be called "Pixel Shooter," and it will be a 2-player game. The game's goal will be to survive against the enemy trying to eliminate you as long as possible. Each player will have a certain amount of lives. The player who loses all of their lives first loses the game.

## Course Topics
Implementing this game will require matrix transformations, lighting, and texture materials. Player movement will be a feature in this game. The movement of the players and projectiles will use matrix translations. As players move around, gravity will be applied to their character as they jump around the level, dodging projectiles. Additional transformations like scaling are utilized to create each unique platform.
An advanced feature that will be implemented will be collision detection. There will be collision detection between projectiles and players, platforms and players, and projectiles and platforms. If a projectile intersects a player, they will lose a life; if a projectile intersects a platform, it will be
destroyed. Also, we will be using Physics-based simulations throughout the game to model projectile and player speeds.

## Interactivity
Each player will have their own set of controls. Player 1 will use the "w", "a", "s", and "d" keys to move their character and "t" to shoot. Player 2 will use the up, left, down, and right arrows to control their character's movements and "shift" to shoot. Each player will start with a fixed set of lives at the start of each game. If a player loses all of their lives, the game will end.
